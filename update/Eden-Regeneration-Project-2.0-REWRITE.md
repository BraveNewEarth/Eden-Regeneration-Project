# Eden Regeneration Project 2.0
## From Contemplation to Regeneration — Georgetown's Next Great Work

**In one sentence:** Protect the retreat center's Mission & Ministry purpose while building a plug-and-play Regenerative Demonstration Campus next door — making Georgetown's ecological commitments visible, measurable, and something the world can replicate.

## Why This Exists

Forty years ago, I was loading nuclear weapons onto B-52 bombers.

Today, I tend 55 acres of mountaintop land in the Blue Ridge — land Georgetown entrusted to serve students and retreatants who come here seeking reflection, healing, and purpose.

This is not a proposal to convert a retreat center into a farm or an event venue. It is a proposal to build something beside it. Something that turns Georgetown's commitment to "care for our common home" from a principle into a practice you can walk through, taste, and measure.

## The Two-Zone Strategy

The core idea is clean: protect what already works, and build what's missing right next door.

### Zone A — Calcagnini Contemplative Center (55 acres): The Anchor

CCC stays what it is — Georgetown's Blue Ridge sanctuary for contemplative retreat, hosted and protected by the Office of Mission & Ministry. That identity is non-negotiable.

What deepens is the experience. Carefully placed moments of formation-through-stewardship — a native habitat zone here, a quiet reflection garden there — woven into the landscape only where they enrich the contemplative experience, never where they crowd it. CCC becomes the spiritual center of gravity for everything Eden does: "care for our common home" as lived practice, not a slogan on a wall.

### Zone B — The Regenerative Demonstration Campus: Where Eden Grows

Two adjacent properties, each playing a distinct and necessary role in the larger system.

#### High Meadows Estate — The Heart (South Property, ~14 acres)

This is the investment that matters most. A historic estate built circa 1896, sitting on open, flat meadow with existing structures and direct road access — High Meadows has everything a demonstration campus needs to move fast and produce real results.

This is where pilot food production launches. Where demonstration gardens take root. Where soil-building programs begin generating measurable change within the first growing season. And where PhD-level regenerative education finds its true field campus — real hands in real soil, with real data to back it up.

High Meadows is not a secondary consideration. It is the Eden Regeneration Project.

#### The North Parcel (22 acres) — The Engine Room

A second adjacent property with a historic 1936 structure and existing facilities. This parcel serves as the operational backbone: equipment storage, workshop and maker space, tool libraries, biochar kilns, and the kind of working infrastructure that keeps a regenerative operation running day to day. Think of it as the engine room that makes High Meadows possible.

## What Makes This Different

Universities can purchase "sustainability" as branding. This is not that.

Here, contemplation stays protected — CCC is never converted into a working farm. Regeneration becomes the applied campus next door, centered on High Meadows. And the result is a model Georgetown can genuinely replicate — one that moves clearly from **Formation → Practice → Measurement → Replication**.

In an age where information is abundant and cheap, what remains genuinely rare is formation, discernment, leadership, and hands-on systems practice. Eden doesn't put Georgetown's value in a report. It puts it in living soil.

## Three Pillars

### 1. Farm-to-Retreat Table

Real food. Real proximity. Real meaning.

It starts at High Meadows: market gardens, perennial beds, compost systems, and seasonal harvests grown specifically for the retreat kitchen — small, consistent, and measured from the first harvest. As the North Parcel comes fully online as an operational hub, the effort scales: storage, processing capacity, and training cohorts drawing from students, staff, and community partners. Every year, a transparent yield, soil, and water report alongside an open operations dashboard shows exactly what's happening, what it costs, and what it produces.

### 2. Living Laboratory for Regenerative Education

Georgetown stops merely analyzing problems. It starts field-testing solutions.

High Meadows becomes a demonstration campus in the truest sense — soil health, water retention, biodiversity, food systems, and energy feasibility all running as live, documented experiments. Student practicums and faculty research integrate naturally into the landscape. A fellows and residency pathway, starting with three to five visiting practitioners and scholars per year, grows only when the proof of demand is clear. What worked. What didn't. What it cost. What it saved. All of it published openly.

### 3. Ecological Spirituality in Action

The inner and the outer, walking the same ground.

Retreatants at CCC gain the option — never the obligation — to experience "care for our common home" as something tangible and alive. Guided stewardship moments. Story-maps that trace food from soil to table. Seasonal rhythms made visible in the landscape. A place where ecological conversion and spiritual formation don't simply coexist — they feed each other.

## How We Get There

This is designed to be easy to say yes to — because it begins with proof, not belief.

### Phase 1: Prove It (Days 1–90)

Authorize a small feasibility team to deliver: baseline site data and constraints, a pilot plot plan for High Meadows showing what can realistically be grown in year one with available labor, conservative-to-ambitious cost ranges, a governance framework that keeps Mission & Ministry protected, and an acquisition feasibility brief covering both properties.

### Phase 2: Plant It (Months 3–18)

Install the first demonstration garden and soil-building program at High Meadows. Begin measured production for the retreat kitchen. Run one or two pilot workshops using the North Parcel's facilities as proof of concept.

### Phase 3: Scale It (Months 18–48)

Expand the production and education footprint. Establish the fellows and residency rhythm. Publish Georgetown's Regenerative Campus Node playbook — the model other institutions can study and follow.

## Governance: How This Stays Real

This only works with clear sponsorship and clear guardrails.

The **Office of Mission & Ministry** serves as mission sponsor — the guardrail that keeps CCC as a retreat center. That is non-negotiable. **Facilities and site operations** handle the day-to-day running of the land. **Faculty fellows and a program coordinator** drive academic integration and research. **Sustainability reporting and learning outcomes** own the measurement. A **steering committee** — drawing from Mission & Ministry, Sustainability, key academic partners, and operations — keeps everything aligned and accountable.

---

## What We Measure

This becomes real only when it is tracked.

On the land: soil organic matter trends over time, water infiltration and retention rates, and biodiversity across pollinators, birds, and expanding habitat zones. On the food side: pounds produced each season and annually, cost per pound as a live learning metric, and what percentage of each harvest actually reaches the retreat kitchen. On the learning side: retreatant engagement with optional stewardship activities, student and faculty projects completed, and workshops hosted with their outcomes published.

---

## The Ask

Approve a 90-day feasibility and proof-of-concept plan for the two-zone strategy.

**CCC stays Mission & Ministry centered.**

**High Meadows becomes the regenerative heart — where Eden grows.**

**The North Parcel becomes the operational backbone that makes it all run.**

Will you help Georgetown plant this future?
